This is my first (better working) calculator, where I spent some time improving the logic and polishing the details. The calculator supports basic mathematical operations and includes some small enhancements to make it more user-friendly.

A Nice Touch:
One of the cool features is a mechanism that prevents entering multiple dots in a row – so you can’t type something like “1.2.3” or “......................”. While it’s not a core functionality, I think it’s a nice addition that makes using the app more convenient!

Future Plans:
Themes: I’d like to add the ability to change the calculator’s appearance, including a theme that mimics the look of the iPhone calculator, as well as other creative styles.
Advanced Mode: I’m planning to introduce advanced mathematical functions like cos, sin, tan, and other scientific features.
I’m open to feedback, suggestions, and any support in further developing this project.
